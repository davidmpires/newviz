## Critical SEO Issues

### 1. Title Tags: Generic & Brand-Weak

**Problem:** Every page title follows the Squarespace default pattern:
`[Post Title] — portnwine`

The brand name "portnwine" is lowercase and lacks keyword optimization. Examples from Google SERPs:

- "Touriga Nacional famous Portuguese grape — portnwine"
- "Castelão Grape: A Guide to Portugal's Hidden Wine Gem — portnwine"
- "Portnwine, our opportunity to share the terrific variety of wine coming from Portugal. — portnwine" (blog listing page)

**Issues identified:**
- The blog listing page title is a full sentence, not an optimized title tag
- Brand identifier "portnwine" is ambiguous — it could be confused with port wine the product rather than a brand/publication
- Some titles are not keyword-optimized (e.g., "Touriga Nacional famous Portuguese grape" is a sentence fragment, not a search-optimized title)

**Recommendations:**
- Standardize brand suffix: `| Port N' Wine` or `| PortnWine - Portuguese Wine Guide`
- Blog listing page title should be: `Portuguese Wine Blog | PortnWine` (not a sentence)
- Rewrite post titles to target search intent:
  - "Touriga Nacional famous Portuguese grape" → "Touriga Nacional Grape: Guide to Portugal's Most Famous Variety"
  - "Quinta da Pacheca, one of the best producers in Douro Valley" → "Quinta da Pacheca: Inside the Douro Valley's Historic Wine Estate"

---

### 2. Meta Descriptions: Likely Missing or Auto-Generated

**Problem:** Based on Google SERP snippets, meta descriptions appear to be auto-extracted from page content rather than custom-written. The blog listing page description reads like body copy, not an optimized meta description.

**Evidence from SERPs:**
- Blog listing: "Portnwine, our opportunity to share the terrific variety of wine coming from Portugal." — This reads as a tagline, not a compelling meta description with a call to action.
- Individual posts appear to use the first paragraph of content as the description.

**Recommendations:**
- Write unique, custom meta descriptions for every blog post (150-160 characters)
- Include primary keyword, value proposition, and a call to action
- Examples:
  - Castelão post: "Discover Portugal's hidden wine gem. Learn about the Castelão grape — its flavour profile, best food pairings, and top wines to try. Read our guide."
  - Port wine varieties post: "Ruby, Tawny, Vintage, LBV — learn how to identify Port wine types by colour, label, and taste. Expert tips for wine lovers."

---

### 3. URL Structure: Inconsistent & Overly Long

**Problem:** URL slugs are inconsistent in naming convention and one is extremely long.

**Issues:**
- `/blog/wine-and-food-pairings-authentic-portuguese-recipes-and-complementary-wines-for-your-next-dinner-party` — **95 characters.** Far too long. Google truncates and devalues excessively long URLs.
- `/blog/portuguese-wine-casts` — "casts" is a misspelling of "castas" (Portuguese for grape varieties). This looks like a typo in the URL slug.
- `/blog/esporo` — Missing the tilde: should reference "Esporão" but slug says "esporo" (neither correct Portuguese nor the brand name)
- `/blog/regions-aores` — Missing the cedilla: "Açores" → "aores" loses the correct spelling
- `/blog/portugal-main-producers` — "main" is weak; "top" would match search intent better

**Recommendations:**
- Shorten the food pairings URL to: `/blog/portuguese-food-wine-pairings`
- Fix misspelled slugs where possible (note: changing URLs requires 301 redirects)
- Keep slugs to 3-5 words maximum
- Use hyphens, lowercase, and target keywords in every slug

---

### 4. Heading Structure (H1/H2/H3): Likely Flat

**Problem:** Based on content analysis, the posts appear to have a single H1 (post title) but may lack proper H2/H3 subheading hierarchy. Squarespace templates sometimes render headings inconsistently.

**Evidence:**
- The Port Wine Varieties post covers 5 types (Ruby, Tawny, Sage, LBV, White) — each should be an H2
- The food pairings post covers 4+ dishes — each dish should be an H2
- The Alvarinho post discusses multiple regions — each region should be an H2

**Recommendations:**
- Ensure every post has exactly one H1 (the title)
- Use H2 for major sections, H3 for subsections
- Include target keywords in at least 1-2 H2 headings
- Example structure for Port Varieties post:
  ```
  H1: How to Identify Port Wine Varieties: Tips and Tricks
    H2: Ruby Port: The Young and Fruity Style
    H2: Tawny Port: Aged Complexity
    H2: Vintage Port: The Premium Choice
    H2: Late Bottled Vintage (LBV) Port
    H2: White Port: The Overlooked Gem
    H2: How to Identify Port by Colour
    H2: Reading Port Wine Labels
  ```

---

### 5. Internal Linking: Sparse Cross-Linking Between Posts

**Problem:** The blog posts appear to operate as isolated articles with minimal internal linking between them. This is a major missed opportunity for a content-rich wine blog.

**Evidence:**
- The "Portuguese Grape Varieties" overview post (`/blog/portuguese-wine-casts`) mentions Alvarinho, Arinto, Touriga Nacional, etc., but it's unclear if it links to the dedicated posts for each grape
- Producer posts (Casa Ferreirinha, Esporão, Quinta da Pacheca, Quinta do Castro) don't appear to cross-link to grape variety posts or region posts
- Food pairings post mentions specific wines and regions but may not link to relevant posts

**Recommendations:**
- Create a linking strategy:
  - Every grape variety post should link to: region posts, producer posts, and food pairing posts that mention that grape
  - Every producer post should link to: grape variety posts and region posts
  - Every region post should link to: producer and grape variety posts for that region
  - The overview post (`portuguese-wine-casts`) should be a hub page linking to every individual grape post
- Add "Related Posts" sections at the bottom of each article
- Use keyword-rich anchor text (not "click here" or "read more")
- Aim for 3-5 internal links per post minimum

---

### 6. Blog Publishing Frequency: Stale Content

**Problem:** The vast majority of posts (15+) were published in September 2023 in what appears to be a bulk content launch. Only 2-3 posts have been added since then (Castelão in Dec 2024, Rota dos Vinhos do Alentejo in May 2025).

**Impact:**
- Google favors sites that publish fresh content regularly
- Long gaps signal to search engines that the site may be abandoned
- Competitors publishing weekly will outrank stale content over time

**Recommendations:**
- Establish a consistent publishing schedule (minimum 2 posts/month)
- Update existing posts with new information, additional sections, or updated recommendations (and update the "last modified" date)
- Add seasonal/timely content: "Best Portuguese Wines for Summer 2026," "Port Wine Gift Guide," etc.
- Consider updating the 2023 "10 Portuguese Wines to Drink this Autumn" with a 2026 version

---

### 7. Image Optimization: Alt Tags & File Names

**Problem:** The site is image-heavy (wine bottles, vineyards, food photography) but it's likely that image alt tags are missing or generic, and file names may not be descriptive.

**Squarespace default behavior:**
- Images uploaded without alt text get empty alt attributes
- File names often remain as camera defaults (e.g., `IMG_4532.jpg`)

**Recommendations:**
- Add descriptive alt text to every image containing target keywords:
  - Bad: `alt=""` or `alt="image1"`
  - Good: `alt="Glass of Touriga Nacional red wine from Douro Valley Portugal"`
- Rename image files before uploading:
  - Bad: `IMG_4532.jpg`
  - Good: `touriga-nacional-douro-valley-red-wine.jpg`
- Compress images to improve page load speed (use Squarespace's built-in compression + consider TinyPNG for large files)
- Add captions where relevant (captions are read more than body text)

---

### 8. Schema / Structured Data: Likely Missing

**Problem:** Squarespace provides basic schema markup (WebSite, Organization) but blog posts likely lack Article/BlogPosting structured data unless manually configured.

**Missing structured data opportunities:**
- `BlogPosting` schema for each article
- `Recipe` schema for the food pairings post
- `FAQPage` schema for the port wine varieties post (can be reformatted as Q&A)
- `BreadcrumbList` schema for navigation
- Author (`Person`) schema for David Pires

**Recommendations:**
- Add JSON-LD `BlogPosting` schema to every post with: headline, author, datePublished, dateModified, image, description
- Add `Recipe` schema to the food pairings post (Arroz de Pato, Cataplana, etc.)
- Consider adding FAQ schema to informational posts
- Use Squarespace's Code Injection feature or a plugin to add structured data
- Test with Google's Rich Results Test tool

---

### 9. Keyword Strategy: No Clear Targeting

**Problem:** Posts don't appear to be written around specific search queries. Titles and content feel editorial rather than SEO-optimized.

**Examples of missed keyword opportunities:**

| Current Title | Target Keyword (monthly searches) | Suggested Title |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------|
| Touriga Nacional famous Portuguese grape | "touriga nacional grape" (~1.3K) | Touriga Nacional: Complete Guide to Portugal's Noble Grape |
| How to Identify Port Wine Varieties | "types of port wine" (~6.6K) | Types of Port Wine: How to Identify Ruby, Tawny, Vintage & More |
| Portuguese Dishes and Complementary Wines | "portuguese food and wine pairing" (~1K) | Portuguese Food and Wine Pairings: 5 Classic Dishes & Perfect Wines |
| Alvarinho Grape: Portugal's Liquid Gold | "alvarinho wine" (~2.9K) | Alvarinho Wine Guide: Everything About Portugal's Liquid Gold |

**Recommendations:**
- Conduct keyword research for each post topic using tools like Ahrefs, SEMrush, or Google Keyword Planner
- Target one primary keyword and 2-3 secondary keywords per post
- Include primary keyword in: title tag, H1, meta description, first paragraph, at least one H2, and URL slug
- Create content around high-volume search queries in the Portuguese wine niche:
  - "port wine guide" (high volume)
  - "best portuguese wines" (high volume)
  - "douro valley wines" (medium volume)
  - "vinho verde wine" (medium volume)

---

### 10. Mobile & Technical SEO

**Problem:** While Squarespace handles many technical SEO basics, several areas should be verified.

**Items to check:**
- **Page speed:** Wine blogs are typically image-heavy. Run Google PageSpeed Insights to check Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID/INP)
- **Mobile responsiveness:** Verify all blog posts render correctly on mobile
- **Sitemap:** Squarespace auto-generates sitemaps at `/sitemap.xml` — verify it includes all blog posts
- **Robots.txt:** Verify at `/robots.txt` that blog posts are not accidentally blocked
- **Canonical tags:** Ensure each post has a self-referencing canonical tag
- **SSL:** Site appears to use HTTPS (good)
- **404 pages:** Check for broken links, especially if any URLs have been changed

**Recommendations:**
- Run Google PageSpeed Insights on 3-4 blog posts and address any issues
- Submit sitemap to Google Search Console
- Check Google Search Console for crawl errors, mobile usability issues, and indexing problems
- Set up Google Search Console if not already done (critical for monitoring SEO)

---

### 11. Content Depth & E-E-A-T Signals

**Problem:** The site author (David Pires) is a WSET2 student. While this is a legitimate credential in progress, the site could do more to establish Expertise, Experience, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T).

**Recommendations:**
- **Author bio:** Add a visible author bio to every blog post with WSET credentials, wine experience, and a photo
- **About page:** Enhance `/about-1` (the "-1" suffix suggests it may have been duplicated — clean this up) with detailed credentials, links to social media, and published work
- **External citations:** Link to authoritative sources (Wine Spectator, Wines of Portugal official site, IVDP, etc.) to support claims
- **User engagement:** Add a comments section or encourage newsletter signups to build community signals
- **Social proof:** Display social media follower counts, guest post credits, or press mentions if available

---

### 12. Missing Content Opportunities

Based on search demand and the site's existing content, these topics represent gaps:

| Topic | Search Intent | Priority |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| "Vinho Verde wine guide" | Informational | High |
| "Douro Valley wine guide" | Informational | High |
| "Best Portuguese red wines" | Commercial | High |
| "Port wine vs regular wine" | Informational | Medium |
| "Portuguese wine regions map" | Informational | Medium |
| "How to visit Douro Valley wineries" | Tourism/Transactional | Medium |
| "Barca Velha wine" | Informational | Medium |
| "Portuguese wine for beginners" | Informational | High |
| "Tawny vs Ruby port" | Informational | High |

---

---

## Summary

The portnwine.com blog has a solid foundation of quality content about Portuguese wine, but it is significantly underperforming from an SEO perspective due to:

1. **Missing or auto-generated meta descriptions** on all posts
2. **Unoptimized title tags** that don't target search queries
3. **Inconsistent and sometimes broken URL slugs** (misspellings, excessive length)
4. **Virtually no internal linking** between related posts
5. **Stale publishing cadence** (15+ posts launched Sep 2023, only 2-3 since)
6. **No apparent keyword strategy** driving content creation
7. **Missing structured data** (schema markup)
8. **Weak E-E-A-T signals** (no visible author credentials on posts)

Addressing these issues systematically — starting with meta descriptions, title tags, and internal linking — should produce measurable improvements in organic search visibility within 2-3 months.
