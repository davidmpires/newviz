  INDIVIDUAL BLOG POST SCHEMAS
  =====================================================

  OPTION A (Recommended): Add each post's schema to that
  specific post using Squarespace's per-page Code Injection:
    1. Open the blog post in editor
    2. Click the gear icon (Settings)
    3. Go to the "Advanced" tab
    4. Paste the relevant script block into "Page Header Code Injection"
    5. Save

  OPTION B: If you want a simpler approach, paste ALL of
  these into the site-wide header Code Injection. Google
  will only read the schema that matches the current page URL.

Older Sage Ports and Crusted Ports should be decanted as sediment forms over time. Younger Ports like Ruby, Tawny, and most LBVs are filtered before bottling and can go straight from bottle to glass."
